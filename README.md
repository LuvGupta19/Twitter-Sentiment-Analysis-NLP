Kaggle dataset used - https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/download

Here i will perform sentiment analysis of text data.
Given tweets about six US airlines, the task is to predict whether a tweet contains positive, negative, or neutral sentiment about the airline. This is a typical supervised learning task where given a text string, we have to categorize the text string into predefined categories.

To solve this problem, follow the typical machine learning pipeline. First import the required libraries and the dataset, then do exploratory data analysis to see if we can find any trends in the dataset. Next, perform text preprocessing to convert textual data to numeric data that can be used by a machine learning algorithm. Finally, will be using machine learning algorithms to train and test our sentiment analysis models.

The sentiment analysis is one of the most commonly performed NLP tasks as it helps determine overall public opinion about a certain topic. We performed an analysis of public tweets regarding six US airlines ,and used machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression, SVM, and random forest algorithm and achieved an accuracy of around 94.5% at best (Random forest).
